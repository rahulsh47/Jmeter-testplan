# JMeter

## Overview
JMeter is an open-source performance testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It's a popular choice for analyzing and measuring the performance of various services, particularly web applications. Here's a breakdown of what JMeter does:

## What it Does
- **Load Testing** : Simulates a high number of concurrent users accessing a server or application to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Performance Testing** : Measures response times, throughput (requests per second), and other metrics to gauge an application's performance under load.
- **Functional Testing** : Can be used to test basic functionalities of web applications by simulating user interactions like login or form submissions.

## Key Features
- **Free and Open Source** : Anyone can download and use JMeter without any licensing cost.
- **GUI and CLI Support** : Offers a user-friendly graphical interface for building test plans and also allows headless execution through the command line.
- **Wide Range of Protocols** : Supports testing various protocols beyond HTTP, including FTP, JDBC databases, SOAP/REST web services, and more.
- **Scalability** : Can be used to simulate a large number of users for comprehensive load testing.
- **Extensible** : Allows plugins and integrations for additional functionalities.

## Pre requisites
- **Java** : JMeter requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher. You can verify your Java installation by running java -version in your terminal. If you don't have Java, download and install it from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.
